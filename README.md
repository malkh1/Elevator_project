### ðŸ“„ GENERAL USAGE NOTES
**requests.txt**
- Takes a list of values of user inputs which is sent as requests to the elevator. 
- Follows the format: time, currentFloor, floorDirection, floorStop
(where time is the time the request is being sent in the format "13:34:03.23", currentFloor is the current floor of the user,
floorDirection is the direction of the floor as "True" if moving upwards, "False" if moving downwards, floorStop is the final destination of the passenger.)

Example:

13:12:04, 4, false, 2 ->
The elevator starts at floor 4 at 1:12pm, travels downwards to floor 2.

17:39:34, 5, true, 6 ->
The elevator starts at floor 5 at 5:39pm, travels upwards to floor 6.

**Floor.java and Elevator.java**
- These classes are not testable as their methods are already being tested in the Scheduler.java class
